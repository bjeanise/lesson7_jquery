### Project Description:
The objective of this assignment is to provide guidance on accessing elements
using jQuery syntax and on using built-in jQuery syntax.  In this exercise, an
application was built that displayed the elements containing a recipe's
ingredients and instructions when a user clicks the associated headers.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. *Chapter 7 and the assignment illustrated jQuery theory and applications.*
    The assignment, related reading material, and interactive exercises and
    examples covered jQuery syntax, selectors, events; basic jQuery animation
    methods; and jQuery DOM traversing methods.

2. *The importance of examples and instructional guidance in learning jQuery programming.* The step-by-step instructions were instrumental in my completing 
the assignment.  

3. *The importance of practice.* In lesson 7, the W3schools website and interactive exercises facilitated my learning jQuery.  I still am a bit overwhelmed but
felt confident to at least give the Extra Credit Assignment a try. Once again,
practice *(and lots of it)* is very important in learning jQuery!
