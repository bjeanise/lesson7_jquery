Course Title: Web Application Development

Assignment Date:  Started March 11, 2018 -- completed March 20, 2018

Student Name:  Barbara Siplin


Project Description:

The features added to enhance the Recipe Display Application for this extra
credit assignment are as follows:

•	A css event changed the h1 header from its original green to “lightskyblue.”
    Example:	$("h1").css("background-color", "lightskyblue");

•	A DOM traversal enabled display of the first “h3” and last “h3” content 
    (the recipe ingredients and instructions).
    
    Examples:  	    
    var ingr = ("h3").first();
    $(this).display('ingr');
     var instr = $(this).display.last("h3");
     
•	Animation example---the appending of the contents of the last h3 element
    $("this").append (instr);
  
•	A double click animation created to allow the reader to view more of the 
    page--- when viewing the recipe instructions online -- and in anticipation
    that there may be more recipes or additional information.
